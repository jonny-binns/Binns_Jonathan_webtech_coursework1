                The railfence cipher is a very simple, easy to crack cipher. It is
                a transposition cipher that follows a simple rule for mixing up the
                characters in the plaintext to form the ciphertext. The railfence
                cipher offers essentially no communication security, and it will be
                shown that it can be easily broken even by hand.


                Although weak on its own, it can be combined with other ciphers,
                such as a substitution cipher, the combination of which is more
                difficult to break than either cipher on it's own.

                Many websites claim that the rail-fence cipher is a simpler "write
                down the columns, read along the rows" cipher. This is equivalent
                to using an un-keyed columnar transposition cipher.
