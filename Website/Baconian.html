              The Baconian cipher is named after its inventor, Sir Francis Bacon.
              The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter
              is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters. In the original cipher,
              these were sequences of 'A's and 'B's e.g. the letter 'D' was
              replaced by 'aaabb', the letter 'O' was replaced by 'abbab' etc.

              This cipher offers very little communication security, as it is a
              substitution cipher. As such all the methods used to cryptanalyse
              substitution ciphers can be used to break Baconian ciphers. The
               main advantage of the cipher is that it allows hiding the fact that
                a secret message has been sent at all.
