          <p id="RailFenceParagraph">
            The railfence cipher is a very simple, easy to crack cipher. It is
            a transposition cipher that follows a simple rule for mixing up the
            characters in the plaintext to form the ciphertext. The railfence
            cipher offers essentially no communication security, and it will be
            shown that it can be easily broken even by hand.

            Although weak on its own, it can be combined with other ciphers,
            such as a substitution cipher, the combination of which is more
            difficult to break than either cipher on it's own.

            Many websites claim that the rail-fence cipher is a simpler "write
            down the columns, read along the rows" cipher. This is equivalent
            to using an un-keyed columnar transposition cipher.

          <p id="BaconianParagraph">
            The Baconian cipher is named after its inventor, Sir Francis Bacon.
            The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter
            is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters. In the original cipher,
            these were sequences of 'A's and 'B's e.g. the letter 'D' was
            replaced by 'aaabb', the letter 'O' was replaced by 'abbab' etc.

            This cipher offers very little communication security, as it is a
            substitution cipher. As such all the methods used to cryptanalyse
            substitution ciphers can be used to break Baconian ciphers. The
             main advantage of the cipher is that it allows hiding the fact that
              a secret message has been sent at all.
